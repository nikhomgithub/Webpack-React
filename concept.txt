Webpack-basic-0
have html+css+js
when we want to opent we compy file path 
and opent in chrome

Webpack-basic-1
have html+css+js(bundle.js)
we need to link bundle.js with index.html
we use webpack.config.js and $webpack -p as production 
to create bundle.js 
How ever we did not link it with css while webpack 
and did not link manually with index.html
so there is no css

webpack-academind
have 2 mode webpack:build & webpack-dev-server
webpack:build
need to import all css at app.js
need to put cssloader in webpack.config.js
it will create dist/bundle.css in this folder
webpack-dev-server
same as webpack:build except location of bundle
it will create bundles.css internal module to run

webpack-react
this is the basic react boiler plate (without css)

webpack-react-css
this is the basic react boiler plate with css
